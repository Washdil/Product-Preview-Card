## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was one of my first hands on practice doing css and html for the first time and i found it 
difficult but later on i got casual and confortable with it and gradually recalled all the important concept at ones and doing some googling along with doing this challenges was the best part but the biggest achievement was building something on my own not copying a tutorial was a good feeling, in terms of learningn it was a simple project in terms of learning some concept, but helped me boosting my confidence in doning the projects.







### Continued development

With this project i got handson experience with the layous in css and i still need to improve my layouts particularly flex and grid and i also want to improve my skills in animations.
